I would say that this person's audio aura is happy and energetic because the average value for energy and danceability
was above 0.5 and its danceabaility was especially high with the value of 0.71646.
However, it might not be a very good way to calculate this person's aura because there might be an outlier that is influencing the average a lot.
For example, a person can just have a very bad day and listen to a song that has extremley low energy and danceability which would influence
the average value a lot. Instead, I would suggest using a median value to find out the audio auro because median will not be influenced by
those outliers.
