Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

With a small number of simulations, the simulator predicted that portugal has the highest probability
of winning the world cup, which is totaly different from the predictions that was made with more tries.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

AFter 10000 tries, I would call it good enough because this is when the result stops to change
even if you increase the number of tries greatly.
